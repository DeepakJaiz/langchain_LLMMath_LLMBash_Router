# langchain_LLMMath_LLMBash_Router

### Aim
**LLM Math**
In this we do complex word math problems.
**LLM Bash**
In this we use LLMs and a bash process to perform simple filesystem commands.
**Router Chain**
In this we see how to use the RouterChain paradigm to create a chain that dynamically selects the next chain to use for a given input.<br/>
Router chains are made up of two components:<br/>
- The RouterChain itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call)<br/>
- destination_chains: chains that the router chain can route to<br/>
